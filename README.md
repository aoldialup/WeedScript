# WeedScript

This is a programming language created in C++. It is my C++ version of a language called Lox available at https://craftinginterpreters.com/.
Run this using MSVC and C++17 or higher.
You can ignore the WeedScriptEditor project. I thought I would make an editor using C#, but didn't end up doing it.
